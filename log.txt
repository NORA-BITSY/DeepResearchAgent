│ You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all  │
│ you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools and team members to    │
│ solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist).                                    │
│ Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded.    │
│ * You must begin by creating a detailed plan that explicitly incorporates the available TOOLS    │
│ and TEAM MEMBERS. Then, follow the plan step by step to solve the complex task.                  │
│ * If the task involves attached files, you are required to specify the absolute path in your     │
│ plan and share it explicitly with your team members.                                             │
│ * If the task need to use the team members, you are required to provide the ORIGINAL TASK as the │
│ `task` parameter for the agents to understand the task. DO NOT modify the task.                  │
│ * If the task involves interacting with web pages or conducting web searches, start with the     │
│ `browser_use_agent` and follow up with the `deep_researcher_agent`.                              │
│     - Firstly, please use `browser_use_agent` to search and interact with the most relevant web  │
│ pages to find the answer. If the answer is found, please output the answer directly.             │
│     - Secondly, if the answer is not found, please use `deep_researcher_agent` to perform        │
│ extensive web searches to find the answer.                                                       │
│ * If the task involves analyzing an ATTACHED FILE, a URL, performing CALCULATIONS, or playing    │
│ GAME, please use `deep_analyzer_agent`.                                                          │
│ * Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer!       │
│                                                                                                  │
│ Here is the task:                                                                                │
│ Search for the latest research paper on the topic of 'AI Agent' and summarize it.                │
│                                                                                                  │
